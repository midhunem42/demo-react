This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## TEST

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## API Call
The api [https://randomuser.me/api/0.8/?results=20](https://randomuser.me/api/0.8/?results=20) has CORS issue. I've tried  proxying the api, But did n't work for me. So that I used [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en) this plugin. Enable this plugin to get results.

## Username and Password

username = "admin"
password = "password"

## Local Storage 

I have used redux-persist for storing the data in localstorage
